## Setup

```
cd lib && bower install
cd ..
http-server
```

## Basics

> For this section, I wrote some starter DOM elements in the `index.html` file.

1. Write a selector that select only the first of the sibling li elements. Make the text for that item bold, and underlined.
2. Make all li elements behave as inline elements.
3. Only the odd section elements should have a border.
4. Only the even li elements should have a lime background.
5. Only the first aside element in the 2nd section should have blue font color.
6. There are three div elements with instructions inside them about which side of the screen they should be displayed on. Follow those instructions.
7. Using vanilla JavaScript, update the HTML of the element with the id of `vanilla_output` with the following text: "This content generated with vanilla JavaScript".
8. Using jQuery, update the HTML of the element with the id of `jquery_output` with the following text: "This content generated with jQuery".

## JavaScript concepts
1. Explain what hoisting is. Provide your answer below.

  **Student answer:**
  Hoisting is a behavior in Javascript where variable and function declarations are brought to the top of their current scope, allowing them to be used prior to their declaration.

2. What is a callback? Why do we use them in JavaScript? Provide your answer, and code a simple example below.

  **Student answer:**
  A callback is a function that is passed to another function as an argument, allowing it to be excecuted at another point in time inside the intial function.

  Example:
    ```
    function myFunction(callback) {
      // do this first
      callback();
    }

    function myCallback() {
      // then do this
    }

    myFunction(myCallback);
    ```
## Functions and operators

> In `main.js` do the following:

1. Write a function named `modulus` that takes two arguments. The function should use the modulo operator to return the remainder between the first and second arguments.  e.g. `modulus(10, 3) // Should return 1`.

2. Write a function named `doMath`. This function takes three arguments.  The first two will contain integer values. The third argument will be a function reference. Write two more functions named `add` and `subtract`. Execute the `doMath` function to add two numbers together. Then execute the `doMath` function to subtract the two numbers.

## Arrays

> In the `main.js`, I started you off with a simple array.

1. Write a function named `sortedPlanets` that returns an array of the planet names sorted alphabetically.
2. Write a function named `reversedPlanets` that returns an array of planet names that are reversed (i.e. "htraE").
3. Write a function named `longPlanets` that returns an array containing only the planet names that are 7 characters long, or longer.

## IIFE

1. In the file named `IIFE.js`. Write an IIFE that defines a global variable named **FruitMaker**. It should contain a private array holding the following strings: "apples", "bananas", "cherries", "huckleberries".
2. The IIFE should expose in its public interface a getter named `getFruits()` that returns all fruits, and a setter named `addFruit()` that provides the ability to add a new fruit to the array.
3. In the file named `AugmentedIIFE.js`, augment **FruitMaker** with a function named `slices()` that accepts two arguments: the name of the fruit, and the number of slices to make. It should return an array containing the name of the fruit duplicated how ever many slices was requested.

  For example: `slices("apples", 2)` should return `["apples", "apples"]`

## XHR

1. Write a function named `getAnimals` that uses the jQuery `ajax` method to retrieve the `data/animals.json` file. When you execute the functions, it should just log *just the array* of animals to the console when the async is complete. Make sure you provide a prompt of "animals" when logging the array.
2. What are the four HTTP verbs that you can use in an XHR that correspond to the CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete)?
  **Student answer:**
  The four HTTP verbs are GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

3. Why did we use Promises when dealing with asynchronous XHR calls?
  **Student answer:**
  Asynchronous XHR calls allows the browser to continue functioning as normal while the request is being handled. If a callback function was provided along with the XHR call, when the request completes (or the server sends a status update), the appropriate callback function can be executed. However, more complex requests and callbacks can quickly become very complicated (e.g. Pyramid of Doom). In order to simplify more complex requests (i.e. dependent XHR calls), promises can be used to handle success and failure events by creating a deferred object to handle asynchronous actions.

1. Provide a simple example of the syntax for handling a Promise.

  **Student answer:**
  ```
  // Create promise
  function getData() {
    var deferred = Q.defer();
    $.ajax({
      // settings
    }).done(function(data){
      deferred.resolve(data);
    }).fail(function(error){
      deferred.reject(error);
    });
    return deferred.promise;
  };

  // Call site of promise
  getData()
    .then(function(data){
      // Do this with data when available
    }).fail(function(error){
      // Do this with error
    });
  ```

## Scope and this

What gets logged to the console when the following code executes? Explain why.

**Student answer:**
  The number 42 is logged to the console because this refers to the object that owns the function, which in this case is the window object. In the global scope the value of answer is 42.

```
var answer = "42";

function steve() {
  luke();
}

function luke() {
  var answer = "0";
  greg(answer);
}

function greg(answer) {
  var answer = "666";
  console.log( this.answer );
}

steve();
```
